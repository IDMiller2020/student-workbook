## Daily Journal:
## Read Asynchronous Code > [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks/) and answer the following questions:
1. What are some of the signs and causes of Callback Hell? <br>
*A lot of nested hard to follow programming.* <br>
2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved? <br>
*Asynchronous means the function might take time to return information and we don't know how long it will take.  Call back functions allow us to watch for a change while performing other tasks then take action when the specified change occurs.* <br>
3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix Callback Hell. <br>
*Keep your code shallow, modularize your code, handle all errors.* <br>
