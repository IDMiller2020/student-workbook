## Read Building Blocks Of Web Development > Cheating At Design and answer the following questions: <br>

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design? <br>
*So far I am most excited about learning/becoming familiar with Bootstrap to speed up programming.  I'm also amazed at all the keyboard shortcuts available that I had no idea existed.* <br>

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas. <br>
- [Nice Page](https://nicepage.com/website-templates)
- [Canva](https://www.canva.com/websites/templates/)
- [Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots)

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone? <br>
*Good design can give website visitors a feeling of confidence and trust in the legitimacy and quality of your organization.  If people see a bunch of misspelled words, bad grammar, and poor design work, it will reflect poorly on the person or organization represented by the website.  If people see feel like the website is "sketchy" or confusing, they arelikely to go somewhere else.*
