## Weekly Reflections (Optional):
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course. <br>
*The first week was tough but I generally enjoyed the challenges and problems I faced.  I feel like the biggest thing I need with HTML and CSS is to practice practice practice.  I still feel like I have to look almost everything up but I am starting to feel more comfortable with every challenge I complete.*
