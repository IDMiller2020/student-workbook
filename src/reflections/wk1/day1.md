# Day 1 - Intro to Codeworks

## Read Building Blocks Of Web Development > GIT 101 and answer the following questions:

## 1. In your own words, why do we use Git?
*Git is a distributed version control system. Git allows multiple developers to work on the same code without creating conflicts. Copies of the code are distributed between the Git server and each individual developers local machine for safety. Git also allows for code to be restored back to a previous version.*

## 2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?
*This is how Git handles multiple developers working on the same code in parallel without conflicts. Later, branches can be merged back together*

## 3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub
*Git is the actual distributed version control system and GitHub is the remote repository that ties all the local repositories together and provides the distributed redundancy.*
