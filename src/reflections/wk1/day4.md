## Daily Journal:
## Read Building Blocks Of Web Development > Wire-framing: A Comprehensive Guide and answer the following questions:
1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? <br>
*To get stake holder input and buy-in early in the planning stages of a project.*

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful? <br>
*The different levels of detail are low-fidelity, mid-fidelity, and high-fidelity.  Low-fidelity contain the least amount of detail and can often be hand drawn sketches of the basic layout.  Low-fidelity is useful for inexpensive quick sketches to help get basic feedback from stakeholders on the general direction and to help describe basic layout options available for the website.  Mid-fidelity contains additional detail like dummy text and photos and the layout and scale are usually more precise.  Mid-fidelity can be useful for having more detailed discussions with project stakeholders on some of the style and sizing detials of the website.  High-fidelity are usually used later in the project and contains actual color photos, text, and backgrounds.  High-fidelity wire-frames are useful for making decisions about final details for colors, font styles, interactive elements, and menue systems.*

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not? <br>
*I think it depends on the size and complexity of the project.  It seems like even the simplest project could benefit from a low-fidelity wireframe to sort out the basic framework of the website.  On more complex projects, Mid and high-fidelity wire-frames could definiely misunderstandings between the stake holders and the people responsible for creating the web site.*
