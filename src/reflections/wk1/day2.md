## Daily Journal:

## Read Building Blocks Of Web Development > CSS and answer the following questions:

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
*A Pseudo-Class is a key word added to a slector that allows styles to be applied only under special circumstances.  For example :hover will apply the applicable styles only when the users pointer is hovering over that element.*

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
*Specificity refers to values assigned to CSS rules that are used to determine which rule should be applied when multiple rules are targeting the same element with differing values.  The rule with the highest Specificity will be applied.  For example, if one rule is targeting an element by tag name (specificity = 1) and another rule is targeting that same element using an id (specificity = 100), the rule targeting the element by id will be applied.*

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
*The !important feature will apply the associated rule no matter what.  No specificity value can change a rule applied with the !important feature.  This can lead to confusion when trying to figure out why rules are not being applied to elements as expected using the standard specificity methods.*
