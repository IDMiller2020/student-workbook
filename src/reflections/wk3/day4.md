## Daily Journal:
## Read Advancing with JS > [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-ObserverPattern/) and answer the following questions:
1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve? <br>
*The Observer Patern allows for one-to-many data binding between elements.  This helps solve the problem of needing separate push/pull code for every peice of you need to keep in sync with other data in the code.* <br> <br>
2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern? <br>
*Subscribe, Unsubscribe, and Brodcast.* <br> <br>
3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom. <br>
*The proxy objects in the bcw-template are copies of the data in the state or store.  Using ProxyState.on allows for connections to be made between objects and functions.  For example we can watch different objects such as an array of lists or and array of tasks and then whenever something is added or deleted from those objecst a draw function can be triggered.* <br>
