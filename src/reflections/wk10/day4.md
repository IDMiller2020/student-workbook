## Daily Journal:

## Read [Foundations of C# > C# Enum's](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk10/03-Enums/#c-enum-s) and answer the following questions:

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them? <br>
   _Strongly typed constants that allow you to assign symbolic name to values. Enums can be used any time you want to use descriptive names for values instead of the values themselves. Like high, medium, and low instead of 0, 1, 2._ <br>
   <br>
2. How can you modify an Enum? <br>
   _By default, enum values start a zero. If you want to start at a different value, you set the first enum identifier at whatever value you want the values to start with. For example, high = 1 would then mean that medium would be 2 and low would be 3 instead of the default 0, 1, 2._ <br>
   <br>
3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could) <br>
   _I have not used them yet but I could have use enums in Rock, Paper, Scissors. I used 1, 2, 3 but could have use enums so that Rock was 1, Paper was 2, and Scissors was 3 which would have made my code more readable._
