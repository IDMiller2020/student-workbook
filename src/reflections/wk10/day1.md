## Daily Journal:

## Read [Foundations of C# > C# Data Types](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk10/01-CSharpGenerics/) and answer the following questions:

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different? <br>
   _Value type: directly contains a value in it's own memory space. <br>
   Reference type: contains a pointer to the place in memory where the data is actually stored.<br>
   Pointer type: I don't completley understand the Pointer type. The assigned reading didn't seem to explain this type in as much detail as the other two types. From the example given for declaring a pointer it looks like maybe you can define a pointer for a type that would normally be a Value type, maybe?_ <br>
   <br>
2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript? <br>
   _Value-type data types directly contain values in it's own memory space. This seems similar to how a JavaScript variable would function if it was used within it's scope._ <br>
   <br>
3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types? <br>
   _Reference types create a pointer that points to a value somewhere else in memory. You can have multiple references pointing to the same value in memory and if the program assigns a new value using one of those references, all the references will now be pointing to the changed value._ <br>
