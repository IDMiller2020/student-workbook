1. What is a List in C#? <br>
   _A C# list is a generic type object similar to an array in JavaScript._ <br>
   <br>
2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?<br>
   _List.Add, List.Contains, List.Exists, List.Find, List.FindAll, List.FindIndex, List.ForEach, List.IndexOf, List.Remove, _ <br>
   <br>
3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use? <br>
   _I would use List.FindIndex and then use List[index] to get the value at that inedex. Or depending on what info you are working with, List.Find might work._ <br>
