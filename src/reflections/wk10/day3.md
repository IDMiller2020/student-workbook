## Read [Dotnet WebAPI's > Welcome to SQL](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk11/01-MySQL-GettingStarted/#establishing-a-connection), and answer the following questions:

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column? <br>
   _The rows are complete objects and the columns are properties of each object like id, name, description, etc._ <br>
   <br>
2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called characters with the values name, age, description as strings, and an int id. <br>
   _CREATE TABLE characters ( <br>
   id int, <br>
   name VARCHAR(255), <br>
   age VARCHAR(255), <br>
   descriptioin VARCHAR(255)
   );_ <br>
   <br>
3. What is the difference between the following statements: "DELETE FROM table name;" and "DROP TABLE table name;". <br>
   _DELETE FROM will delete a specified object in the table. DROP TABLE will delete the whole table._
