## Read [Working In a Professional Environment > Scrum for Small teams](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk8-9/02-ScrumForSmallTeams/) and answer the following questions:

1. How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team? <br>
   _On a small team it may be hard to find a good way to communicate with all the stake holders without derailing progress for the whole team. Finding good ways to communicate appropriate information to the people that need it is very important. On smaller teams it may be necessary to wear more than one hat to help take up the slack if one of the other team members is temporarily taken out for some reason._ <br>
   <br>
2. Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time? <br>
   _Trying to do more than one sprint at a time makes it more difficult accomplish the goals of each sprint in a timely manner without bugs._ <br>
   <br>
3. What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum? <br>
   _The unattainable triangle says a team can accomplish good and cheap but not fast, or fast and good but not cheap, or fast and cheap but not good but there isn't a way to accomplish all three at the same time._
