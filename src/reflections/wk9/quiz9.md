**5.** What is the `Factory` design pattern?

<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

Not sure again but Wikipedia says it is a pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the oject that will be created.
```

**6.** What is test driven development?

<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

```
Test driven development is when you develop a set of automated tests using something like Postman or Puppeteer that basically define the MVP functionality and then program and test as you go so that the program passes the tests and meets the basic functionality requirements.
```

**7.** In Scrum/Agile what is the DoD?

<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

```

```

**8.** Give two examples of a user story:
