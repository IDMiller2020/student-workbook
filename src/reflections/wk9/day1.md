## Reflect on your capstone project so far and answer the following questions and answer the following questions:

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project? <br>
   _We are using HTML, CSS, Bootsrtap, Vue, Node, Mongoose, MongoDb, Git Hub, principles of MVC, RESTful, Pair Programming, and Scrum/Agile methods._ <br>
   <br>
2. What went well so far? <br>
   _Our team has developed a good working relationship and we are switching between pair and individual programming as needed. We are making good progress toward our MVP._ <br>
   <br>
3. What would you do differently? Why? <br>
   _It is hard to find the correct ballance beween asking TAs or instructors for help and working through it as a team. Sometimes I think we struggle with things (bugs, or programming that doesn't do what we expected) too long before asking for help which wastes time. Other times I feel like we are asking TAs and/or instructors to help us figure out which way is the best way to accomplish a feature instead of maybe thinking through how we want to accomplish it as a group in a way that makes sense to us._ <br>
