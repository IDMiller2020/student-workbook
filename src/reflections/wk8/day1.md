## Read [Working In a Professional Environment > An Honest Guide to Building a Powerful Developer Portfolio](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk8-9/01-BuildingAPortfolio/) and answer the following questions:

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide? <br>
   _A Developer Portfolio is a tool to show employers that you know what you are doing, demonstrate your expertise, and to build your brand. Your portfolio can help you stand out among the crowd of other developers that are applyin for the same job._ <br>
   <br>
2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective? <br>
   _The projects you include in your portfolio should have a purpose. Think about why you put them in your portfolio. It might be to demonstrate your skill with a particular language or technology or maybe to demonstrate your skill at multiple different languages._ <br>
   <br>
3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why? <br>
   _I would like to go back through the projects we have worked on in this class and find projects I can clean up and make look good. Right now I feel like most of the projects I have are 80 to 90 percent done but that isn't really what I want to show potential employers. In my portfolio I would like to demonstrate applications that have a nice looking web page and then I want to provide some good examples of Vanilla JavaScript, Vue, NodeJs, Mongoose and MongoDb. We haven't gotten there yet in class but I'd also like to include some examples using C# and SQL._ <br>
