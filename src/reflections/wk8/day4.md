## [Read Working In a Professional Environment > Testing in Vue](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk8-9/04-VueTesting/#introduction) and answer the following questions:

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide? <br>
   _Unit testing: Testing of individual units of code in isolation from eachother.
   Component testing: Testing of components that must be mounted to the DOM.
   End-to-End Testing: Validation of the entier user expereience. How does it work when everything is connected together?_ <br>
   <br>
2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why? <br>
   _I think all of them are needed but I feel like the most important is the unit testing. If you test the peices as you create the program then it seems more likely that you will have less trouble with the whole package if each unit has been tested along the way._ <br>
   <br>
3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why? <br>
   _I think all the testing methods have their place but I feel like if you wait until you are ready to do end-to-end testing before you do any testing, you are asking for a lot of headaches and trouble trying to figure out why the program isn't doing what you expected it to do._
