1. What is Software Development Testing? <br>
   _Software Development Testing is defined as testing the smallest unit of code. The tests should be as simple as possible._ <br>
   <br>
2. What are the benefits of Testing in software development? <br>
   _Testing gives developers peace of mind and confidence knowing that the software has been tested before demonstration or deployment. I can also help prevent rework and troubleshooting since each unit was tested instead of waiting for a complete product._ <br>
   <br>
3. What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development? <br>
   _Until people have tried it or seen it in action, it can be hard to convince them that it is worth the extra time and expense up front. Testing also needs to be planned out and done correctly otherwise you can end up testing a lot of things that don't need to be tested for the functionality of a particular part or unit of the program._
