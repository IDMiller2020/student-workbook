## Daily Journal:
## Read Servers with Node/Express > [MongoDb Relationships](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk5/02-Relationships/) and answer the following questions:
1. What is the purpose of a Query String? <br>
*It allows information to be passed to and from a website by appending it to the end of the URL.* <br>

2. What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next? <br>
*Query parameters are separated from the rest of the url by a "?".  Multiple queries can be chained together after the "?" using the "&" between each query.* <br>

3. When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server? <br>
*They can be used to modify or filter the info you get back from the server.* <br>
