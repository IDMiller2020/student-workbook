:
1. What is a virtual property? <br>
*A virtual property is created using defined functionality, like adding a first, middle, and last name together to get the full name.* <br>

2. When might you use a virtual property? <br>
*An example would be using a function to put names together to form a full name property.  Then the full name property can be used over and over instead of havin to concatenate first, middle, and last names every time you need the full name.* <br>

3. How do you search by a virtual properties value? <br>
*You can't search directly using the virtural propety, you need to concatenate the non-virtual component properties together to search for the virtual property.* <br>
