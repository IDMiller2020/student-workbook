## Daily Journal:

## Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your final project, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point:

This has been a great bootcamp. My only regret is that I wish I could absorb the material faster. I don't feel like I'm as proficient in the subject matter covered in this bootcamp as I should be at this point. I have learned a lot and plan to continue leaning and pursuing a career in Sofware Development no matter if I pass the course or not.
I am planning to spend as much time as possible working through the final project. I will be taking it one step at a time and I'm going to try not to let myself get stuck for too long on one issue before I move on to something else and add the problem to the list of things I need to get help with. That's going to be hard for me because I really like to get each part working before moving on to something else, I don't like to leave things broken.
I would say the thing I enjoyed most about the course so far is the encouragement and patient help I have received throughout the entire course from everyone at BCW. I can't think of a single person at BCW that has ever made me feel bad about not understanding something, or who has not taken the time to help me out and encourage me to keep going.
