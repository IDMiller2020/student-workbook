## Read [Read Foundations of C# > C# Inheritance](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk10/04-Inheritance/) and answer the following questions:

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#? <br>
   _It allows a developer to define a relationship between two classes, a base class and a derived class. The derived class inherits from the base class._ <br>
   <br>
2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class? <br>
   _No, a class does not inherit all member of the base class. Constructors and finalizers are not inherited._ <br>
   <br>
3. How does accessibility affect inheritance? <br>
   _Private members are not visible from child classes. Protected members are only visible in child classes._ <br>
