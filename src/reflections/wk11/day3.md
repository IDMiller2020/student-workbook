## Read [Dotnet WebAPI's > SQL Injection](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk11/03-SQL-Injection/#sql-injection-definition), and answer the following questions:

1. What is SQL injection? <br>
   _SQL injection is a type of cyber attack where arbitrary SQL code is inserted into a database query giving the attacker control over your web application database._ <br>
   <br>
2. What are 3 methods SQL injection can be done by? <br>
   _A user can input malicious query data directly into user input fields that interact with the databas. An attacker can modify cookies to inject malicious SQL. Server variables such as HTTP headers can also be used to inject code into the database._ <br>
   <br>
3. How can we detect and sanitize SQL injection attacks? <br>
   _A basic web application firewall can prvent basic sql injection attacks. As a developer, limit privaleges to the least necessary. For example, if DROP TABLES is not needed in your app, then don't allow acces to it._
