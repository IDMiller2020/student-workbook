## Daily Journal:

## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions:

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement? <br>
   _We used one computer for programming at a time and my partner and I were both actively involved in the process of building our program together. My partner and I swapped roles each day so that we both got experience being the driver and the navigator._ <br>
   <br>
2. What went well? <br>
   _My partner and I worked well together and we were able to talk through almost every line of the code we wrote which helped us not make as many mistakes as we would have individually and also helped us troublshoot issues quickly when things didn't work the way we expected them to._ <br>
   <br>
3. What would you do differently?? <br>
   _I think we could have done better with possibly switching roles a little more often or "stealing" the keyboard from eachother when the navigator had a solution to a problem or the driver didn't quite understand what needed to be done._
