## Daily Journal:
## Read Intro to JS > [JavaScript Functions](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk2/02-Functions/) and answer the following questions:
1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? <br>
*Function declaration: A function declaration uses the "function" key word followed by the name, parameters, and function code block.* <br>
*Function expression: A function expression uses a const declaration in front of the function key word and may or may not have a function name.* <br>
*Arrow function expression: An arrow function expression is a shorter way to write a function expression.* <br>
2. What are the differences in how the function acts (if any) <br>
*A function expression is hoised, meaning that the function call can come before the function declaration in the program.  Function expressions and arrow expressions are not hoisted.* <br>

3. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments? <br>
*Parameters are part of the function declaration and arguments are part of the function call.* <br>

4. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example? <br>
*Higher order functions are functions that either take other functions as arguments or return functions.  An example would be the forEach array method which takes in an array and a function to perform on each item in the array.* <br>
