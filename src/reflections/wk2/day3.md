## Daily Journal:
## Read Intro to JS > Chrome Developer Tools and answer the following questions:
1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style. <br>
Information can be written to the console using console.log directly from the program.  This is useful for debugging when you want to see information about a specific point in the prgram like variable values or when a paricular line of a progam is being executed.  You can also type commands directly into the console to do things like call a function or test conditional statements.  The console is also where error messages are displayed.<br>


2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML? <br>
The Elements tab allows you to view and make experimental, temporary modifications to you HTML and CSS.  Each change made here will immediately update the web page.  Changes you want to keep can be coppied and pasted into your code.  When the page is refreshed, the temporary changes are reset.  This is much faster than switching back and forth between your editor and the web page to figure out what changes need to be made.<br>

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code? <br>
It is better to use the debugging and break point tools.  Together, these tools allow you to step through your program or specified parts of your program and look at real time values to help determine where things are not working as expected.<br>
