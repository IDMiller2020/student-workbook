## Read Intro to JS > Var, let and const and answer the following questions:
1. What is Scope? <br>
*Scope is the part of the program in which a variable is defined.  For instance for a variable defined within a functhion, that variable would only be available within the function (function scope).  A variable defined outside a function in the main part of the program, would be available everywhere (global scope).*

2. What is Hoisting? <br>
Hoisting occurs when a variable is defined after the value assignment.  In this case, when JavaScript gets to the variable assignment statement, it recognizes that the variable is defined later in the program and does not throw an error.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var? <br>
Let is used when the value of the variable will be changed.  Const is used when the vaiable will always have the same value.  Objects can be defined using const but in this case, the object itself can't be change but the objects properties can.  Var is a pre-ES6 term.  Var declarations are globally scoped and can be updated or re-declared anywhere in the program.  Var is also hoisted.
