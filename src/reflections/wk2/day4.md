## Daily Journal:
## Read Intro to JS > [The Mistakes I Made As a Beginner Programmer](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk2/06-Coding-Mistakes/#writing-code-without-planning) and answer the following questions:
1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code? <br>
*Thinking about what you are trying to do and some general ideas for how you might accomplish it helps you determing a logical direction for you code.  You shouldn't try to plan every detail but planning out the major blocks and how you are going to get started will give you a framework to work with that can be modified and built out as you go along.  It can also help with minimizing time wasted on things that don't really help you reach the end goal.* <br>

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck? <br>
*Google it.  Sometimes you just need to understand how something works to use it correctly.  Other times you might find a solution that someone else found and posted.  When using someone elses solution, make sure you understand it thoroughly before using it.* <br>

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways? <br>
*The idea of using better naming in code to reduce or eliminate comments was sort of a paradigm shift for me.  My first instinct was to add comments to clarify code but it makes a lot more sense to just write your code so that it is readable and explains itself.* <br>
*I also realize that at this point I will have a difficult time recongizing a lot of the things this article is warning about but it is good to start thinking about these things as a newbie coder so that as I learn more I will hopefully learn to avoid some of these traps and pitfalls.  I feel like this article would be a good resource to review a couple more times as I go through the rest of the BCW program.*
