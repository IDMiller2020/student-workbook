## Daily Journal:
## Weekly Reflections (Optional):
*I got some good practice and help with CSS and Bootstrap.  I'm feeling better about basic layout and styling.  I already had a little experience with JavaScript functions and objects but I feel like I learned a lot from the lectures, challenges, and check point.  I struggled a lot with the Udemy JavaScript 201 class and was not able to finish that over the weekend.  Unfortunately I probably shouldn't have spent so much time on the Udemy lesson and probably should have spent more time on the Week 2 checkpoint. <br>
Ultimately though, I am still enjoying the struggles and challenges so far and am looking forward to week 3.*
